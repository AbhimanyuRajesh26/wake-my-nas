# Reddit Response - Post on r/synology thread

**Comment to post:**

Thanks everyone for the thoughtful feedback! You've convinced me that using WoL with a NAS storing critical data isn't the best approach.

I've updated the project to reflect this:
- Added a prominent warning about NAS reliability concerns
- Pivoted to better use cases: home servers, desktops, lab machines
- Acknowledged the community feedback in the README

The tool still works great for non-critical devices where convenience matters more than 24/7 availability. But for a NAS with important data, keeping it awake is the right call.

Really appreciate everyone taking the time to share their experience. This is exactly the kind of feedback that makes open source better.
