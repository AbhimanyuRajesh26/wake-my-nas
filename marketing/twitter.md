I got tired of waiting for my NAS to wake up every time I opened my MacBook.

So I built a tool that automatically sends a WoL packet when macOS wakes.

Now my storage is ready instantly. üöÄ

**Tweet 2 (reply to above):**
```
Why not just keep the NAS on 24/7?

- Power savings
- Quieter when not needed
- Extends drive life
- But I don't want to wait

This solves it. Star if you find it useful!
