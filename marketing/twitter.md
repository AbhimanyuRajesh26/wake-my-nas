**Option 1 (Technical):**
```
Built a macOS tool to auto-wake my NAS when I open my MacBook.

No more waiting 30 seconds for network storage to spin up.

3 commands to install, works with any WoL device.

**Option 2 (Problem/Solution):**
```
Problem: Opening MacBook → waiting for NAS to wake → wasting time

Solution: Send WoL packet on Mac wake → NAS ready when you need it

Built it, open sourced it, works great.
