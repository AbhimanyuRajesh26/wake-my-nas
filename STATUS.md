### Homebrew Core Feedback
- Rejected for "notability" - need more users first
- Tool is fine, just not popular enough yet
- Can resubmit once it gains traction

### Key Files
- `wake-my-nas.sh` - Main script (134 lines)
- `wake-my-nas.rb` - Homebrew formula
- `install-service.sh` - LaunchAgent installer
- `com.github.wake-my-nas.plist` - LaunchAgent config

### User Flow
```bash
brew tap dgeske/tap
brew install wake-my-nas
wake-my-nas --discover          # Find MAC address
wake-my-nas --edit              # Set MAC (IP optional)
wake-my-nas-install-service     # Done
```

### Next Steps
1. **Share the tool** - Get users to build notability
   - Reddit: r/homelab, r/synology, r/macOS
   - Hacker News
   - Twitter/X
   - Blog post
2. **Track stars/usage** - Need ~75+ stars for Homebrew Core
3. **Resubmit to Homebrew Core** once notable

### How Users Install Now

- **SHA256:** 143566f79c49c0a56505eeb4744d0f93566b828a5099bba2e467cddc30bbf619

### Why This Exists
Tired of waiting 30 seconds for NAS to wake after opening MacBook. This sends WoL packet when Mac wakes, so storage is ready when needed.

**Status:** Waiting for Homebrew maintainers. Nothing to do until they respond.
